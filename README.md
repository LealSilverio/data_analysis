# Overview

The purpose of this software is for me, as a programmer, to learn about how stocks works, how to analyze data in a large scale, and the signs of a recession. This software analyzes historical stock price data to identify patterns that shows signs of economic recessions. The dataset was found at [Kaggle - Stock Market Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jacksoncrow/stock-market-dataset/data). This dataset "contains historical daily prices for all tickers currently trading on NASDAQ" up to April of 2020. By understanding stocks behaviors and macroeconomic shifts, we can assume when a we are in a recession or about to face one.
